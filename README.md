## Introduction

This repository aims to help beginners understand the fundamentals of ensemble learning by exploring three key methods:
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**
- **Boosting**
- **Stacking**

Each method is implemented with basic examples, and we visualize how these ensembles work on different datasets.
